# Digital Signal Processing Toolbox (Matlab)

This repository contains Matlab codes I developed for teaching an undergraduate course on digital signal processing.

The repository includes codes for:

- Plotting complex signals (magnitude and phase).
- Even-odd signal synthesis.
- Examples of linear and circular convolution.
- Difference equations.
- Forward and inverse Fourier transformations.
- Forward and inverse Laplace transformations.
- Simple FIR and IIR filter implementations.
- Linear and $\mu$-quantization.
- Implementation of DFT and FFT.
- Power spectral density estimation using built-in functions and manual methods.
- Spectrogram plotting and implementation.

## Data Downloading

Some of the codes use additional data for testing. To download the data, use the following command:

```bash
bash download_data.sh
```

I have also written a python version for every code listed here. Please free to check those out [here!]().
